The [REST API documentation](http://devdocs.magento.com/swagger/index.html) published here on the Magento 2 Developer Documentation website describes the REST APIs that are available on the latest release of Magento 2 Community Edition.  This documentation is generated from the code base using [Swagger](http://swagger.io) and represents the state of the code at the time the documentation was generated. However, the REST API documentation is static in that the Magento Developers website (devdocs.magento.com) is not running an instance of Magento.

For information about creating a dynamic API documentation set on your server with live data, see
[Generate local REST API reference
](generate-local.html).
